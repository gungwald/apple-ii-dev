Will Harveyâ€™s Music Construction Set
from Electronic Arts

This is the 1987 Version of the Music Construction Set (MCS). New features include support for the Mockingboard D and the possibility to select the printer interface.

The copy protection of MCS has been well documented in different issues of Hardcore Computist. The softkey for this version was described in the Issue #32.

The original manual of this version was a very low cost variant with instructions for the Apple II, the Commodore 64 and the Atari 8 Bit Computers. Since the only screenshot in the manual was barely visible, I did not bother in scanning it. Instead I decided to remaster it in PDF format using the packaging as covers and omitted the instructions for other systems.
