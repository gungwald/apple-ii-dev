<b>Part 1: Kinds of MockingBoards</b><br>
<br>
The original MockingBoards come in four basic 'flavors': <br>
<br>
Sound I-- produces music tones and a variety of sound <br>
effects (3 voices to 1 Audio Output)<br>
Speech I-- produces speech or limited sound effects <br>
(1 voice output to 1 Audio Output)<br>
Sound II-- 2 x Sound I on a single board (3+3 voices <br>
to 2 Audio Outputs)<br>
Sound/Speech I-- Sound I + Speech I on a single board <br>
(3+1 voices to 2 Audio Outputs)<br>
<br>
Note ...<br>
Audio Output: This goes to a speaker or hi-fi amplifier Voice: a musical note,<br>
sound effect, speech sound, etc. <br>
<br>
<br>
Quite a few of the original MockingBoards were sold. Later MB's use model names<br>
like "MockingBoard A", etc.. The main difference between the original series
and<br>
letter-named boards is wider availability of Speech.<br>
<br>
Edhel Iaur and Mike Mahon supplied details on models A-D. Prices are from a Sweet<br>
Micro Systems ad in the December, 1985 issue of _A+_ magazine:<br>
<br>
MockingBoard A is a stereo music and sound synthesizer with six voices. Suggested<br>
retail price is $99.00. This model has two sockets for adding speech synthesis<br>
IC's so that a user could add speech to one or both Audio Outputs. Except for the<br>
speech upgrade options, MB-A is very similar to the earlier Sound II. <br>
<br>
"MockingBoard B" is just the name of the Speech Upgrade; it is not a separate
MB<br>
board. The kit consists of one speech synthesizer chip. Earlier MB's used the<br>
16-pin SC-01 speech IC, while later board runs provided 24-pin sockets for the<br>
newer (but somewhat flawed) SSI-263 speech synthesizer chip. Suggested kit retail<br>
price is $89.00. <br>
<br>
MockingBoard C is simply a MB-A that has been upgraded by plugging in one speech<br>
chip. Suggested retail price is $179.00. (There was an 'undocumented' upgrade,<br>
obtainable by plugging in the other speech chip, which allowed the board to "sing<br>
harmony" with itself!) <br>
<br>
MockingBoard D is a stereo music, sound and speech synthesizer for the Apple IIc.<br>
It connects to a IIc through a serial port and is, of course, external (unlike<br>
the Slot board models for other Apple II's). Its drivers are very different from<br>
the slot I/O of the other MockingBoards. Suggested retail price is $195.00.<br>
<br>
Phasor is a MockingBoard-compatible sound card produced by Applied Engineering.<br>
Looking at the software that comes with the Phasor may be helpful to MB users.<br>
Phasors may still be available from ABC Direct at 1-800-800-3680 for something<br>
around $100. <br>
<br>
<br>
MockingBoards work on Apple II's with at least 48K RAM. MB can go into any Slot<br>
(except for MB-D, which must plug into a IIc). Most programs expect it to be in<br>
Slot 4; however, it is fairly common for a program which supports MB to ask you<br>
to enter the Slot #. <br>
<br>
Most for-MB products will work with Sound I, Sound II, Sound/Speech I, A, and C.<br>
(Some work with D.) Products that use MB include Ultima III, IV, V Sky Fox, Wiley<br>
Byte', Thunder Bombs, Lancaster, Under Fire, Music Construction Set,<br>
GuitarMaster, and Music Star. <br>
<br>
MB's 0.5 Watt Audio Output(s) can directly drive an 8 Ohm speaker. You can also<br>
run the Output(s) to a hi-fi amplifier. <br>
<br>
Except for speech-only models, MB uses the General Instruments AY-3-8910<br>
Programmable Sound Generator IC. The PSG has 3 on-chip tone oscillators (via<br>
channels A, B ,C) and a Noise Generator (NG). So, for example, the Sound II can<br>
play up to 6 notes or effects at once. The NG on each PSG can be mixed with any,<br>
all, or none of the three tones. <br>
<br>
<br>
Many MB "Speech" version boards use the Votrax SC-01 Speech Synthesizer
IC. The<br>
SC-01 uses 64 phoneme sounds to produce speech. MB software lets you adjust<br>
duration of each phoneme in 4 steps, create "rules" for custom sounds,
and speak<br>
sentences from text in BASIC programs. The<br>
SSI-263 speech synthesizer appeared on later model MB's. (At present, more info<br>
on the SSI-263 is not included here.) <br>
<br>
All MB versions use the 6522 Versatile Interface IC to handle board I/O. Except<br>
for the Sound I board, early models have circuit board points to which you can<br>
add cables to utilize I/O ports not needed for Sound or Speech.<br>
<br>
<b><br>
Part 2: Sound Programming</b><br>
<br>
Each Programmable Sound Generator (PSG) has 3 output Channels: A, B, and C. There<br>
are also 3 Tone oscillators, one committed to each Channel, and one Noise<br>
Generator (NG) which can send its output to any Channel(s). Amplitude (output<br>
Level or Volume) and Envelope Control ON/OFF is set for each Channel.<br>
<br>
The PSG's Enable/Disable register has 8 bits. Three bits let you decide whether<br>
or not to send a Tone oscillator''s output to its Channel. For example, you can<br>
enable Tone outputs for the oscillators going through Channels A and B while<br>
disabling Tone output for the oscillator connected to Channel C.<br>
<br>
The Enable/Disable register also lets you decide whether or not to send the Noise<br>
Generator's output through a Channel. Three bits let you decide which Channel(s)<br>
the NG's output will go through. For example, you can enable NG output through<br>
Channels A and C but not through B; or, disable NG output through all three<br>
Channels, etc.. <br>
<br>
If, for example, Channel A's Tone oscillator output is enabled and NG output is<br>
enabled for Channel A, then, a mixed Tone + NG signal will go through Channel A.<br>
Setting Channel A's Amplitude controls the Level for the mixed signal.<br>
<br>
Often, a programmer will want to individually control the Levels of Tone outputs<br>
(for music) and Noise outputs (for sound effects). This is accomplished by using<br>
one PSG Channel only for Noise and two Channels only for Tones. Since the MB<br>
Sound II has 2 PSG's, a typical game application using the board will have 4<br>
music tones and 2 effects sounds-- each individually controlled for Level.<br>
<br>
More specifically, the user can set Tone Frequency (12 bits, 4 coarse &amp; 8 fine)<br>
and Amplitude (4 bits) for each channel individually. A fifth Amplitude bit lets<br>
you decide if a channel's Level will be "fixed" (use the Level value) or<br>
"variable" (i.e. follow the current Envelope pattern). You have 4 bits
to set<br>
Noise Generator Frequency. <br>
<br>
Tone Freq = A2 Clock Freq/ [ (4096 x Coarse) + (16 x Fine) ] Noise Freq = A2<br>
Clock Freq/ (16 x NG value) <br>
<br>
The Envelope of the combined outputs of enabled sources can be controlled for<br>
Period (16 bits, 8 coarse &amp; 8 fine)** and, roughly, for Shape (4 bits).<br>
<br>
Env Freq = A2 Clock Freq/ [ (65536 x Coarse) + (256 x Fine) ] <br>
<br>
The registers of the PSG are described briefly below: <br>
<br>
Reg. Function &amp; Bit(s) used<br>
<br>
00 A Freq. fine (0-7)<br>
01 A Freq. coarse (0-3)<br>
02 B Freq. fine (0-7)<br>
03 B Freq. coarse (0-3)<br>
04 C Freq. fine (0-7)<br>
05 C Freq. coarse (0-3)<br>
06 NG Freq. (0-4)<br>
07 Enable =0/ Disable =1<br>
<br>
NG on A (5) on B (4) on C (3)<br>
Tone on A (2) on B (1) on C (0)<br>
Ex: Writing $F0 to Reg 07 plays tones A, B, C plus noise on C <br>
<br>
08 A Level (0-3) and<br>
Envelope Control (4): 1 = Use Env; 0 = Use Level value <br>
<br>
09 B Level (0-3) and ...<br>
0A C Level (0-3) and ...<br>
0B Envelope Period Fine (0-7)<br>
0C Envelope Period Coarse (0-7)<br>
0D Envelope Shape (four bits)<br>
<br>
Continue (3) 0= do 1 cycle and set Level to zero Attack (2) 1= count up 0= count<br>
down<br>
Alternate (1) 1= reverse count direction each cycle Hold (0) 1= do 1 cycle and<br>
hold count<br>
<br>
<br>
To program the MB you write to the board's 6522 I/O chip(s). All addresses<br>
reference here are for a MB Sound II (2 Audio Outputs) in Slot 4. <br>
<br>
$C400 ORB1 function to perform, OUT 1<br>
$C480 ORB2 function to perform, OUT 2<br>
$C401 ORA1 data, OUT 1<br>
$C481 ORA2 data, OUT 2<br>
$C402 DDRB1 data direction, OUT 1<br>
$C482 DDRB2 data direction, OUT 2<br>
$C403 DDRA1 data direction, OUT 1<br>
$C483 DDRA2 data direction, OUT 2<br>
<br>
Before sending music, etc. data to the MB you must Initialize the board's I/O. To<br>
Initialize the 6522's: Store $FF at $C402 and the other three DDRxx addresses.<br>
This needs to be done by your program just once. <br>
<br>
Your program gets access to a PSG via the 6522 by using a few basic Function<br>
codes which set the PSG's I/O control lines: <br>
<br>
Set Inactive = $04 Set PSG Reg# = $07 Write Data = $06 Reset = $00 <br>
<br>
<br>
To Write to a PSG register: Tell the PSG which Register you wish to access (i.e.<br>
Set the "current register" #) and Write the data. This is easiest to do
with<br>
subroutines to handle the basic Functions. <br>
<br>
Example Subroutines (for Output Channel 1): <br>
<br>
Set Reg # 1000: A9 07 8D 00 C4 A9 04 8D 00 C4 60<br>
<br>
Write Data 100B: A9 06 8D 00 C4 A9 04 8D 00 C4 60 <br>
<br>
Notice that each Function sub ends by setting the PSG control lines to Inactive.<br>
<br>
Similarly, to do a Reset (set all PSG regs to zero) ... <br>
<br>
Reset 1016: A9 00 8D 00 C4 A9 04 8D 00 C4 60<br>
<br>
<br>
To put the value $55 in PSG Register 02 (Channel B Freq. fine) .... <br>
<br>
1080: A9 02 put Reg# in A<br>
1082: 8D 01 C4 store A at the Data address ORA1 1085: 20 00 10 JSR to Set Reg#<br>
(sets "current register" to Register 2)<br>
1088: A9 55 put the value $55 in A<br>
108A: 8D 01 C4 store A at the Data address ORA1 108D: 20 0B 10 JSR to Write Data<br>
($55 goes into PSG Register 2) 1090: 60 Exit from subroutine<br>
