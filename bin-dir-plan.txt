ProDOS/BASIC Bin Directory
Implement BASIC.SYSTEM extension
Find /boot/bin directory using current PREFIX
If /boot/bin does not exist then, write "No bin directory found"
Read names of all files in /boot/bin
Sort the file names so that they can be searched with a binary search
On each invocation:
	Search the file name list for the command provided
	If it exists, invoke that file: text, bin, sys, bas
	If it does not exist, allow BASIC to continue
